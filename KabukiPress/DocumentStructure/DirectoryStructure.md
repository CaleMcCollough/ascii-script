### Directory Structure

[Section video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS2vQG4gUE3vXWV_K9XScQw)

The directory structure of a KabukiPress website is based on I am You Language (IMUL) Markdown. Each KabukiPress site is called a KabukiPress Module and is contained in a single folder with the option to add KabukiPress Modules with links to other folders. The HTML equivalent to `.html` is the `ReadMe.md` file.

#### Folder Structure

The folder contents gets parsed with an interpreter and any files or folders that start with an underscore will not be copied the output folder. All other files will be copied to the output folder in the same tree structure as the KabukiPressModule, minus anything with a leading underscore.

##### Required Files and Folders

* ReadMe.md
   * _Includes
   * _Layouts
      * Default.html
   * _SASS

#### _Includes

The `_Includes` folder contains HTML components similar to React components. Each `HTML` file contains a snipped of code that can be included into other components to create fully functional websites.

#### _Layouts

The `_Layouts` folder contains templates for the web page types such as the Default, Page, Post, or other user-defined page types. A Layout is different than an Include in that the Include is just a component in a web page but cannot create a webpage without using a layout.

The only required layout is the `Default.html` file in the `_Layout` folder and an `_Includes` folder.
