The Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Script (Script2) is the reference implementation of the SCRIPT Specification, which can be found at:

[https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/blob/master/spec/data/readme.md](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/blob/master/spec/readme.md)

Script2 is useful for doing Unicode text processing with String Localization, interprocess communication, and unit testing. Script2 is defined int he SCRIPT Specification but the SDK does more than the spec defines. The spec doesn't define the Seam Tree unit test framework.
