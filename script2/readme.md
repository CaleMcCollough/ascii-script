The **S**erial **C**hinese **R**oom, **I**nterprocess, and **T**elemetry Specification, or [SCRIPT Spec](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/blob/master/spec) for short, is a definition for a family of technologies based of the Chinese Room Thought Experiment (CRTE) and ASCII C0 Codes. Script2 is useful for creating all kinds of apps, games, operating systems, consumer electronics, and computers with. The SCRIPT Spec specifies the [ASCII Data Specification](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/tree/master/spec/data), and Abstract Data Type Specification for concrete implementations of Abstract Data Types, and the [SCRIPT Protocol](https://github.com/kabuki-starship/script2/tree/master/spec/protocol/), which defines a Software-defined Networking Protocol for building plug-and-play ad-hoc networks and Intranets of Things, similar to a mix of USB Human Interface Devices (USB-HID) with the Boarder Gateway Protocol.

Script2 uses a seam-oriented approach that allows you to break your software up into seams and test each seam in isolation, similar to pealing back the layers of an onion. Script2 is a nanoframework, which means that it is designed to be the core of other SDKs, microframeworks, and monolithic frameworks.

The Automaton Standard Code for information Interchange (ASCII) Data Types are a set of Plain-Old-Data (POD) and complex data structures that can define most commonly-used computerized data. ASCII Data Types support all of the C++ data types, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, and MSB Variant Encoding, and a set of map data structures that use contiguous memory and can be formally verified using ***Formal verification*** by mathmatical techniques to verify compliance to the data specifications for applications such as aerospace and millitary. The use of contiguous memory is very useful for interprocess communication and network apps bacause the memory offest translate naturally across the assembly-line boundry, which is a fancy way of saying a different `.exe` or `.dll` file or interprocess pipe. The data structures work as inter-process pointers that allows multiple processors to communicate and to perform reflections.

Script2 is used to create the I am You Language Compiler (IMUL) that powers the Astartup, or A* (pronounced "A Star") Startup using the **C**hinese **R**oom **A**bstract **S**tack (Crabs) Machine, which is a pen-and-paper-compatible push-down automaton, which is a facy way of saying a stack machine, and it is capible of processing trees and graphs of **R**emote **P**roceedure **C**alls (RPC) and Chines Room Operations.
