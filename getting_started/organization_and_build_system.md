### Organization

Script2 and Kabuki Toolkit are organized is a minimalist modular format where the code is in the root folder. This book focuses on Kabuki Graph, which is a graphing calculator built with Kabuki Toolkit and Eigen. There is also a KabukiPress Cookbook for learning to make websites, and a Kabuki Theater Cookbook for learning to make 2D and 3D games.
