### Script2

Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (SCRIPT) Specification, or SCRIPT Spec for short, is a definition for a family of technologies based of the Chinese Room Thought Experiment. Script2 is useful for creating all kinds of apps, games, operating systems, consumer electronics, computers, etc with. Script2 was designed from scratch with a Sandwich Development Method to clean up and minimize the amount of code required to create apps as well as the memory and overhead processing using modern C++1x with cross-language bindings. Script2 specifies:

* ASCII Data Types
* Universal Addressing
* SCRIPT Protocol

You can find the SCRIPT

The Automaton Standard Code for information Interchange (ASCII) Data Types are a set of POD and complex data structures that can define most commonly-used computerized data. ASCII Data Types support all of the C++ data types, UTF-8, UTF-16, and MSB Variant Encoding, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 1024, 4096, and 4096, and 8192-bit signed and unsigned integers, 16, 32, 64, and 128-bit floating-point numbers, and a set of map data structures that use contiguous memory. The use of contiguous memory is very useful for interprocess communication and network apps. The data structures work as inter-process pointers that allows multiple processors to communicate and to perform reflections.

Universal Addressing, the Telemetry Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and **Telemetry** Protocol, is a form of GPS coordinates that uses latitude and longitude as well as height above or below the earth's surface convey Telemetry data and to route ultra-high-speed internet signals.

The Script2 Protocol is a software-defined networking protocol (SDNP) based on the Chinese Room that supports both byte-encoded messages and human-readable text scripts. SDNP have the unique property that the languages may be swapped out dynamically at run-time and multiple language may coexists with each other in a single virtual machine. This is performed using the Chinese Room Abstract Stack Machine (Crabs), also called the Magic Crabs.

Crabs is a Virtual Machine Framework that uses some simple rules for how to detecting and handling keys, function parameters and arguments, and erroneous data and interpreting byte streams. Crabs is built for raw speed using modern C++ stack programming. Stack programming is a technique where as much data is placed on the stack as is possible and appropriate, and functions are optimized to minimize the number of register pushes and pops associated with function calls by taking advantage of how the C and C++ compiler handles the stack.

Script2 is the reference Script2 API. Script2 is responsible for dictating the Script2 Protocol SDNP features such as handling keys, function parameters and arguments, and erroneous data. When feature is introduced to the Script2 Protocol, the feature must have a defined Script2 implementation. This does not mean that is the only implementation, only that it is the reference implementation. Feel free to make as many implementations as you would like; gold stars going to all who get AI to write it's own implementation.
