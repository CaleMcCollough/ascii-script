This book details how to write portable software and perform Issue Driven Development in Modern Embedded-C++ with Kabuki Toolkit (KT) and Script2. The audience of this book is intermediate to expert programmers, though beginning C++ programmers may still find the book useful and will teach you Modern Embedded-C++ the right way. You would want to read this book if you're trying to learn Kabuki Toolkit or Script2, or if you are interested on how to build Modern Embedded C++ SDKs.

Serial Chinese Room, Interprocess, and Telemetry (**SCRIPT**) Script (**Script2**) is an implementation of the SCRIPT Specification, which defines the Automaton Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) Data Structures. ASCII Data Structures are a set of contiguous data structures that assist in interprocess communication and data serialization and marshalling.

KT is AnEmbedded-C++ Firmware-to-Software Development Kit (**F2SDK**) built on top of Script2. KT was developed to run the A-Startup, A* (pronounced "A Star") Startup. KT provides a set of tools for creating software with C++

This Getting Started chapter will briefly explain the:

* Chinese Room AI Thought Experiment
* Kabuki Theater Theory of Consciousness.
* Script2 and the SCRIPT Specification.
* Kabuki Toolkit.
* Organization and Build System.
